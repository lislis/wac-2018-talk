      # and where to find them

      # Long answer

      after this introduction!

      ---

      ## Intro slide

      - Open Knowledge Foundation DE

      - people's struggle with and fear of technology

      - video games

      - generative / creative code

      - personal enjoyment of technology

      ## Party:4:2

      It's like getting to know someone better.

      --

      But that someone is your computer.


      ---

      Remind people of the beautiful things machines can do.

      ---

      Does not solve the problem of unethical use of machines by technologists.

      Nor the lack of digital literacy of people.

      --

      But we can tackle problems one step at a time.

      ---

      # We have a party to throw!

      ---

      Ingredients:

      - Music

      - Decorations

      - Interaction

      ---

      # Music

      procedually generated snippets

      ToneJS for synths and scheduling

      create 8 second snippets of melodies on the fly

      based off a base note and scale

      randomly selecting notes that fit the scale to fill meassures

      plus a little beat

      and some effects

      ---

      ## JukeGen

      - on npm

      ---

      # Decorations aka visuals

      WebGL fragment shader

      feeding fft data directly into the shader

      look ma, no framework \o/ less dependencies

      but performance is poor, which I could have guessed

      potentially more perf improvements tho

      ---

      # Interaction

      WebGamepad API

      why not mouse and keyboard?

      people like clicki interfaces, most users don't like keyboards

      take away the feeling of breaking something

      Controllers are associated with playful/ game-y things, perfect for this!

      Very underrated, but also very complex

      Contro looks very cool, but didn't work with my controller :/

      So I wrote some custom code

      Query the gamepad in a loop

      Explorative button mapping, but not too confusing?

      which mappings would feel intuitive?
